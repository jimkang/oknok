standard-bail
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimkang/standard-bail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimkang/standard-bail)

Makes callbacks that log and/or call the outer callback if there's an error so that you don't have to. An abstraction of the most typical kind of error handling callback.

It creates a callback that checks for an error and if there is one, it (optionally) logs it and (optionally) passes it back to the `done` function. If there isn't, it calls the success handler function you've defined.

Basically, you get to skip writing 

    if (error) {
      log(error, error.stack);
      outerDone(error);
    }
    else {
      â€¦
    }

and get to just write whatever was in the else. (Obviously, don't use this if you have to handle an error in a special or different way.)

It's just a way to DRY up callbacks a bit.

Installation
------------

    npm install standard-bail

Usage
-----

Instead of:

    function doAThing(outerDone) {
      someAPI(aCallback);

      function aCallback(error, result, otherThing) {
        if (error) {
          log(error, error.stack);
          outerDone(error);
        }
        else {
          // Use result and otherThing in case in which someAPI call succeeded.
        }
      }

You can do:

    var sb = require('standard-bail');

    function doAThing(outerDone) {
      someAPI(sb(log, successHandler, outerDone));

      function successHandler(result, otherThing) {
          // Use result and otherThing in case in which someAPI call succeeded.
      }
    }

Here, `successHandlers` doesn't worry about errors. `sb` will have already handled it in a way a jillion other errors are handled: by logging it and/or passing it to `done`.

`sb` has three parameters, log, outerDone, and success. 

All are optional can be undefined or null. You really should have either a outerDone or a log, though, in order to avoid silent failures.

`success` will be passed all of the non-error parameters passed to the callback. `outerDone` is the done callback passed to the outer function. `log` will be passed the error and the error stack to, presumably, log.

If you want `log` to default to `console.log` (or any other log), you can use `lodash.curry` like so: `var sb = _.curry(require('standard-bail'))(console.log)`. (Keep in mind that `console.log` can causes problems in some cases, as it is synchronous. However, it's fine in a quite a few cases as well.)

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
